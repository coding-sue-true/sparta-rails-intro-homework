*Intro Rails Homework*

* Create a full crud resource for Posts.
* You  can only use the rails generate for model, controller and migration. No use of scaffolds
* You need to create all the forms necessary to do the crud actions on the resources. (Look at form helpers that we looked at, use the lessons we have done today as a reference)

Bonus

* Use your seed file to seed data into your database
* Style your app to look smart
* Create the Users resource
